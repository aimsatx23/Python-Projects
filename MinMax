# Description of Program: This program prompts the user to enter integers 
# until the user enters -9999. The program then prints the number of integers 
# entered, the maximum integer, and the minimum integer. If the user enters -9999 as 
# the first number, the program prints a message indicating that no numbers were 
# entered.
