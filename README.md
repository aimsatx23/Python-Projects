These are some of my personal projects that I have worked on using the Python coding language. These projects include, but are not limited to: a calendar application, a jumble puzzle solver, and a Fibonacci number generator application.

Every Python file and application is independent of one another, except for Benford.py (benford.txt is the output produced by the Benford.py file, while MortalityCharts.csv is the file read by Benford.py) and Jumble.py (where the file wordlist.txt is used to create the dictionaries needed for Jumble.py).
